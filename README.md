PCB Estimator is a .NET 3.5 compliant program.

No install is needed. The program can run from any location (i.e. the Desktop).

If .NET 3.5 is not on your PC
the program will reach Microsoft and attempt to install
.NET 3.5 on your computer. This is all handled internally
by the .NET Common Language Runtime.

Any computer that will run .NET 3.5 compliant programs will run PCB Estimator.exe.
See Microsoft.com for exact system requirements.
